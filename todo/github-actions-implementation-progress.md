# GitHub Actions Implementation Task Progress

## Project: unfunt - GitHub Actions CI/CD Setup

### Overview
This document tracks the progress of implementing GitHub Actions workflows for the unfunt project, based on the .github-demo directory structure.

### Requirements
- [x] Main CI workflow in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- [x] Test workflow (unit tests, code checking)
- [x] Release management workflow
- [x] Code quality and automation features (autofix, bundle size monitoring)
- [x] Use pnpm as package manager
- [x] Restrict workflows to current repository only

### Task Progress

#### ✅ 1. Analysis Phase (COMPLETED)
- [x] Analyzed existing .github-demo structure and workflows
- [x] Reviewed ci.yml, test.yml, release.yml, autofix.yml
- [x] Examined size monitoring workflows (size-data.yml, size-report.yml)
- [x] Reviewed package.json scripts and dependencies

#### ✅ 2. Main CI Workflow (COMPLETED)
**File:** `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- [x] Created main CI workflow
- [x] Configured triggers for push and pull requests
- [x] Integrated test workflow call
- [x] Added continuous release for dev branch
- [x] Used pnpm package manager
- [x] Restricted to uphg/unfunt repository

#### ✅ 3. Test Workflow Implementation (COMPLETED)
**File:** `.github/workflows/test.yml`
- [x] Created reusable test workflow
- [x] Implemented unit test job using `pnpm test:run`
- [x] Implemented lint and check job using `pnpm lint:check`
- [x] Added TypeScript check via build process
- [x] Used Node.js 20 and pnpm setup

#### ✅ 4. Release Management (COMPLETED)
**File:** `.github/workflows/release.yml`
- [x] Created release workflow triggered by version tags
- [x] Integrated test workflow as prerequisite
- [x] Added build and publish steps
- [x] Configured GitHub release creation
- [x] Set up Release environment protection
- [x] Repository restriction applied

#### ✅ 5. Code Quality & Automation (COMPLETED)
**Files:** 
- `.github/workflows/autofix.yml`
- `.github/workflows/size-data.yml`
- `.github/workflows/size-report.yml`

- [x] **Autofix workflow**: Automatic lint fixes on PRs
- [x] **Size data workflow**: Bundle size analysis and data collection
- [x] **Size report workflow**: PR comments with size comparison reports
- [x] All workflows use pnpm and Node.js 20
- [x] Repository restrictions applied

#### ✅ 6. Documentation (COMPLETED)
- [x] Created task progress documentation in todo directory
- [x] Documented all workflow implementations
- [x] Listed technical specifications and features

### Technical Specifications

#### Workflows Created:
1. **ci.yml** - Main continuous integration
2. **test.yml** - Reusable testing workflow
3. **release.yml** - Production release management
4. **autofix.yml** - Automatic code fixing
5. **size-data.yml** - Bundle size data collection
6. **size-report.yml** - Bundle size reporting

#### Key Features:
- **Package Manager**: pnpm exclusively
- **Node.js Version**: 20
- **Repository Restriction**: `uphg/unfunt` only
- **Branch Strategy**: master (main), dev
- **Test Coverage**: Unit tests + ESLint + TypeScript checks
- **Automation**: Auto-fix PRs, size monitoring, continuous releases
- **Security**: Environment protection for releases

#### Workflow Triggers:
- **CI**: All pushes and PRs
- **Release**: Version tags (v*)
- **Autofix**: Pull requests only
- **Size Monitoring**: Push and PR to master/dev branches

### Status: ✅ COMPLETED
All required GitHub Actions workflows have been successfully implemented according to specifications. The CI/CD pipeline is ready for use with comprehensive testing, automation, and monitoring capabilities.
